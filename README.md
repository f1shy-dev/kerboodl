## ðŸ“š&nbsp;Kerboodl

A simple way to download PDF books from kerboodle.

## Usage

Visit the hosted version on [Github Pages](https://f1shy-dev.github.io/kerboodl)

## How does this work?

kerboodl has no server-side code, all it does is fetch a URL from which kerboodle gets data on the book (hence why you run a small snippet on a book's page, so kerboodl doesn't have to handle authorisation and other complex processes), and then process that data into a small downloader site (which converts the images to PDF inside the browser).

## Warning

**I am not responsible for any content that is downloaded/obtained using this tool, and how is it used, with malicious intent or not.** You must have access to the books already to download them, and use the app at your own risk.
